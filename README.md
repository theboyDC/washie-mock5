# Algorithm-Focused Mock Assessment – Version 2

## Overview
This assessment evaluates your understanding of core algorithmic patterns
commonly tested in coding interviews.

Focus areas:
- String manipulation
- Lists and dictionaries
- Stack logic
- Sliding window technique
- Recursion
- Mathematical reasoning

---

## Instructions

1. Implement all functions in `algorithms.py`
2. Do NOT modify function names or parameters
3. Handle edge cases explicitly
4. All tests in `test_algorithms.py` must pass

Run tests using:
pytest test_algorithms.py

---

## Problems

### 1. Reverse Integer
Reverse an integer while preserving its sign.

Example:
123 → 321  
-456 → -654

---

### 2. First Non-Repeating Character
Return the first character in a string that does not repeat.
Return `None` if all characters repeat.

---

### 3. Two Sum
Given a list of integers and a target number,
return True if any two distinct numbers sum to the target.

---

### 4. Valid Palindrome
Return True if a string is a palindrome.
Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case.

---

### 5. Maximum Consecutive Sum
Given a list of integers and a number `k`,
return the maximum sum of `k` consecutive elements.

---

### 6. Fibonacci (Recursive + Memoized)
Return the nth Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization.

---

### 7. Remove Duplicates (Preserve Order)
Remove duplicates from a list while preserving original order.

---

### 8. Balanced Brackets
Check if brackets `()`, `{}`, and `[]` are correctly balanced.

---

### 9. Rotate List
Rotate a list to the right by `k` steps.

---

### 10. Longest Common Prefix
Given a list of strings, return the longest common prefix.

---

### 11. Find Missing Number
Given a list containing numbers from `0` to `n` (one missing),
return the missing number.

---

### 12. Anagram Checker
Return True if two strings are anagrams of each other.

Ignore case and spaces.
